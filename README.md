# Welcome to The Giant's Newsletter!

My life has been a bit of a rollercoaster this past year, and its a struggle trying to keep all of my friends up to date. Thankfully newsletters exist, so I figured that instead of paying for some newsletter, I could just make my own :wink:

## Set up and use

- Create a new email to send the newsletter. I use gmail because it can send up to 500 emails a day for free.
- Create google cloud account and get API token
-- **Create a Google Cloud Project:** Go to the Google Cloud Console, create a new project or select an existing one.
-- ***Enable Gmail API:** Navigate to the API Library, search for "Gmail API," and enable it.
-- *Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials: Go to the Credentials section, create OAuth 2.0 Client IDs. Choose "Desktop app" or "Web application" depending on your needs, and download the `credentials.json` file.
- install dependencies with `pip install google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client`
