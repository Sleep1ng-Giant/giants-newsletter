# Welcome to The Giant's Newsletter!

My life has been a bit of a rollercoaster this past year, and its a struggle trying to keep all of my friends up to date. Thankfully newsletters exist, so I figured that instead of paying for some newsletter, I could just make my own :wink:

## Set up and use

- Create a new email to send the newsletter. I use gmail because it can send up to 500 emails a day for free.
